## Presentation: [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oDLq34QWMs_YJiap-yX4Co6TPRCWv63OjcKn5fpq3Vo/edit?usp=sharing)
- What is a teachable machine / KNN image classifier
- How does teachable machine work
- What is MobileNet model, Imagenet dataset
- What is Transfer Learning
- Logits Activation from MobileNet
- What is KNN
- Existing projects about webcam transfer learning
- What is poseNet
- Existing projects related to poseNet

## Coding session:
- Make a KNN Image Classifier
- Regression with feature extractor
- Posnet
- poseNet + KNN Image Classifier

## Homework:
- Reading: 
  - [How to build a Teachable Machine with TensorFlow.js](https://beta.observablehq.com/@nsthorat/how-to-build-a-teachable-machine-with-tensorflow-js)
  - [Real-time Human Pose Estimation in the Browser with TensorFlow.js](https://medium.com/tensorflow/real-time-human-pose-estimation-in-the-browser-with-tensorflow-js-7dd0bc881cd5])

- Coding: 
  - Add new outputs to the KNN Image Classifier example, mix it with videos, games, or physical computing
  - Or build somthing based on poseNet example.
