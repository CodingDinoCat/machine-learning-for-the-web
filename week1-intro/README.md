# Week 1 Introduction to Machine Learning

## Presentation: [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1s0iT382Pl1DMGKb5xhk7_V3DlW1QQHfHs4snNoS_sIU/edit?usp=sharing)
- Whatâ€™s Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep learning?
- Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning
- Machine Learning output types: Regression, Classification, Clustering, Sequence prediction
- Existing Machine Learning use cases and creative projects
- Machine Learning tools / libraries: Tensorflow, Keras
- Introduction to ml5.js, tf.js, examples, experiments, datasets

## Coding session:
- Install ml5.js, [get started](https://ml5js.org/docs/getting-started)
- Running [Image Classification](https://ml5js.org/docs/image-classification-example) example with ml5.js
- Install tf.js, [get started](https://js.tensorflow.org/#getting-started)
- Running tf.js [get started example](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/tree/master/getting_started)

## Homework: 
- Watch videos of ml5.js: [A Beginner's Guide to Machine Learning with ml5.js](https://youtu.be/jmznx0Q1fP0)
- Pick a project on (Google AI experiments)[https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/ai] or any other projects you know, play with it, and think about what are other ways to be creative.
- Try any of the ml5js [examples](https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-examples) or tfjs [examples](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples), make something based on any of these examples, publish it on your blog / github.
